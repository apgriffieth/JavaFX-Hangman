# JavaFX-Hangman
In this simple 2-player hangman game, a word is entered by one player. A new window then opens with a hangman game setup around the word entered. The player has 6 lives to guess the word. They lose a life for every incorrect guess but not for repeated guesses. If multiple letters are entered, only the first letter is taken.
